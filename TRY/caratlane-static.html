<font style="color:white" face="Comic sans MS" size="5">CaratLane was founded by Mithun Sacheti and Srinivasa Gopalan with a refreshing and courageous objective – to make beautiful jewellery accessible,affordable and forever wearable. <br />
<br />
Since July 2016, we joined forces with India’s most desired and largest jewellery brand, Tanishq, through a strategic investment made by Titan Company in CaratLane. 
This takes us another step closer to achieving our shared mission - to make beautiful jewellery accessible to everyone.<br />
