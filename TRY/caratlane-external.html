<p class="two">CaratLane was founded by Mithun Sacheti and Srinivasa Gopalan with a refreshing and courageous objective � to make beautiful jewellery accessible,affordable and forever wearable.</p>
<br />
<br />
<p class="two">Since July 2016, we joined forces with India�s most desired and largest jewellery brand, Tanishq, through a strategic investment made by Titan Company in CaratLane. 
This takes us another step closer to achieving our shared mission - to make beautiful jewellery accessible to everyone.</p>
